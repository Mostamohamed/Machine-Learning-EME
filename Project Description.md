# Problem definition
From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the
world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.
You are given a dataset for criminals' records and you are required to predict
the “Category” of the crime.
# Steps to solve
A. Load the data and understand the features and the target.
B. Visualize the data using plots like in Seaborn/Matplotlib.
C. Clean the data.
D. Reduce the dimensions of the data. [you can use any of the approaches]
E. Create 3 models, train/test them.
F. Parameters tuning to the model.
G. Compare between the models and state which is better and why.
You can choose any 3 models you want to use, however here are some
examples you can choose from:
SVM - Decision Tree - Bayes Classifier - Random Forest - XGBoost - KNN .. etc.
# The report contain the following:
A. Project Name.
B. Main charts/plots explained.
C. Data cleansing and features engineering steps.
D. Results of the models, mentioning which is better and why.
E. Future work that may be made to enhance the models.
